subtitle: Teacher of Mathematics & Science, Lover of Data
description: 
    Australian born, living in Germany for the time being. I'm finding myself in a time-rich position. So           naturally, I decide to dive a little more deeply into Data Analysis and statistics in the hope of learning a     little more.
    
    I love maths, and I teach what I love in the hope my enthusiasm rubs off on my students. For reasons            unknown I decided that data analysis is something I want to spend time doing. Sometimes I like taking           photos. I lot of the time I like running and cycling. It brings me joy to be kind to others so I do that as     often as possible too!
